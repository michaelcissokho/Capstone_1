# Capstone_1
Springboard Final Submission of Capstone 1

I used python, html, javascript, flask-Wtforms, sql_alchemy to create this project.

The goal of the project was to create a dummy/intro to seeking_alpha. I wanted to create "Michael's Financial Platform" 
where you can see general market data, and high-level along with in-depth data on individual tickers.

Users can write posts on tickers that interest them and all users can see the posts and insight of all users.

I think that going forward I would like to implement trading on the site one day and more in-depth research to create an
all encompassing trading platform.
